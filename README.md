Here, I have not included the .hdf5 file as it was too large to upload
instead of which i have uploaded the pdf file of model classification which when run will produce the desired hdf5 file and needs to be stored in a new directory named "Models"
Models directory should be placed alongside of app directory
It uses Inceptionv3 pretrained CNN for gender classification
DJango for creating web app
